<p>Partial of <a href="#!/reading/findBy" ng-click="sys.goto('findBy','reading')">findBy</a></p>
<p>Used to find all matching records by indexing a field in each record.</p>
<p>For instance if you have a RecordArray of students and you want to find out how many are living in the USA:</p>
<pre type="javascript">
	// "students" is a RecordArray of students' information.
	const students1n2 = students.findByID([1,2]).listValues(name);
	console.log(`Student 1 and 2 are ${students1n2.join(' & ')}.`);
</pre>
